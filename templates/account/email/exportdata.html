<p>Hi, {{ user['fullname']}}!</p>

<p>You have recently requested to export all the data that we have from you in our server.</p>

<p>In the following links, you will be able to download ZIP files that have your personal data, your projects and your contributions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Personal Data: {{personal_data_link}}</li>
    <li>Your created projects: {{personal_projects_link}}</li>
    <li>Your contributions: {{personal_contributions_link}}</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to get new updated versions of these files, just export again your data.</p>

<p>For the projects' data (tasks, task runs and results) you can use the available exporters for your projects.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>
